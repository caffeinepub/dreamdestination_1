  "summary": "Diff adds a TransportOption concept and frontend UI/hooks to fetch options and create bookings tied to a selected option, plus a migration to add transportOptionId to bookings and new transportOptions state. However, key REQ-14/REQ-15 acceptance criteria (full option fields, deterministic default options seeding, and backend seat enforcement/decrement behavior) are not evidenced in the provided diff summary.",

      "id": "REQ-14",
      "requirement": "Transport option API returns, for a destination id, options including transport type, origin, destination, departure date/time (schedule details), total seats, and available seats.",
      "reason": "The TransportOption type shown only includes id, destinationId, transportType, schedule (as Text), and availableSeats. There is no evidence of origin, destination, departure date/time as a structured field, or totalSeats being stored/returned.",

      "requirement": "If transport options are empty/uninitialized, backend provides a deterministic default set for existing seeded destinations.",

      "requirement": "Backend booking creation enforces seat availability by rejecting bookings that exceed remaining seats and reducing availableSeats when a booking is made.",
      "reason": "Frontend performs client-side seat validation and maps backend errors, but the diff summary does not show any backend logic that decrements availableSeats or rejects over-capacity bookings.",

      "requirement": "Booking history continues to work and includes enough stored detail to display the destination and schedule information associated with the booking.",
      "reason": "The backend Booking type adds only transportOptionId (optional) in addition to the existing 'details' Text; the diff summary does not show getBookingsByCaller changes or any guaranteed persisted schedule/route fields beyond an optional reference id and freeform details.",
